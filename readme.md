# `interactive_pipe`
### Concept
- Develop an algorithm while debugging visually with plots, while checking robustness & continuity to parameters change.
- Magically create a graphical interface to easily demonstrate a concept or simply tune your algorithm.

:heart: **You do not need to learn anything about making a graphical user interface (GUI)** :heart:


### Examples

|:-----: |:-----:|
| ![science notebook](/doc/images/scientific_notebook.jpg) |  ![jukebox](/doc/images/jukebox.jpg)
| Sliders are added automatically in your jupyter notebook. This works on Google Collab and the code takes about 40 lines of code. No Widgets, event handlers or matplotlib knowledge required.| Plays some music when you touch the icon. Images can be generated using the OpenAI [Dall-E API helpers](https://github.com/balthazarneveu/interactive_pipe/blob/master/src/interactive_pipe/thirdparty/images_openai_api.py) . Caption added through the title mechanism. Music samples generated by prompting [MusicGen](https://huggingface.co/spaces/facebook/MusicGen) |

----------------------

### Setup
`pip3 install interactive-pipe`

----------------------

### Who is this for? 
#### :mortar_board: Scientific education
- Demonstrate concepts by interacting with curves / images.
- Easy integration in Jupyter Notebooks (popular with Google Collab) 
#### :gift: DIY hobbyist
- You can also use the declarative nature of interactive pipe to make a graphical interface in a few lines of codes. 
- For instance, it is possible to code a jukebox for a toddler on a RaspberryPi.
#### :camera: Engineering *(computer vision, image/signal processing)*
- While prototyping an algorithm or testing a neural network, you may be interested in making small experiments with visual checks. Instead of making a draft quick & dirty code that you'll never keep, you can use interactive pipe to show your team how your library works. A visual demo is always good, it shows that the algorithm is not buggy if anyone can play with it.
- Tune your algorithms with a graphical interface and save your parameters for later batch processing.
- Ready to batch under the hood, the processing engine can be ran without GUI (therefore allowing to use the same code for tuning & batch processing if needed).
- Do not spoil your production code with a huge amount of graphical interface code, keep your algorithms library untouched and simply decorate it.




----------------------

# Tutorials
*Since ipywidgets in notebooks are supported, the tutorial is also available in a [google collab notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1PZn8P_5TABVCugT3IcLespvZG-gxnFbO?usp=sharing)*

## :rocket: Ultra short code
Let's define 3 image processing very basic filters `exposure`, `black_and_white` & `blend`.

By design:
- image buffers inputs are arguments
- keyword arguments are the parameters which can be later turned into interactive widgets.
- output buffers are simply returned like you'd do in a regular function.

We use the `@interactive()` wrapper which will turn each keyword parameters initialized to a **tuple/list** into a graphical interactive widgets (slider, tick box, dropdown men). 

The syntax to turn keyword arguments into sliders is pretty simple `(default, [min, max], name)` will turn into a float slider for instance.

Finally, we need to the glue to combo these filters. This is where the sample_pipeline function comes in.

By decorating it with `@interactive_pipeline(gui="qt")`, calling this function will magically turn into a GUI powered image processing pipeline.


```python
from interactive_pipe import interactive, interactive_pipeline
import numpy as np

@interactive()
def exposure(img, coeff = (1., [0.5, 2.], "exposure"), bias=(0., [-0.2, 0.2])):
    '''Applies a multiplication by coeff & adds a constant bias to the image'''
    # In the GUI, the coeff will be labelled as "exposure". 
    # As the default tuple provided to bias does not end up with a string, 
    # the widget label will be "bias", simply named after the keyword arg. 
    return img*coeff + bias


@interactive()
def black_and_white(img, bnw=(True, "black and white")):
    '''Averages the 3 color channels (Black & White) if bnw=True
    '''
    # Special mention for booleans: using a tuple like (True,) allows creating the tick box.
    return np.repeat(np.expand_dims(np.average(img, axis=-1), -1), img.shape[-1], axis=-1) if bnw else img

@interactive()
def blend(img0, img1, blend_coeff=(0.5, [0., 1.])):
    '''Blends between two image. 
    - when blend_coeff=0 -> image 0  [slider to the left ] 
    - when blend_coeff=1 -> image 1   [slider to the right] 
    '''
    return  (1-blend_coeff)*img0+ blend_coeff*img1

# you can change the backend to mpl instead of Qt here.
@interactive_pipeline(gui="qt", size="fullscreen")
def sample_pipeline(input_image):
    exposed = exposure(input_image)
    bnw_image = black_and_white(input_image)
    blended  = blend(exposed, bnw_image)
    return exposed, blended, bnw_image

if __name__ == '__main__':
    input_image = np.array([0., 0.5, 0.8])*np.ones((256, 512, 3))
    sample_pipeline(input_image)

```
:heart: This code shall display you a GUI with three images. The middle one is the result of the blend



Notes:
- If you write `def blend(img0, img1, blend_coeff=0.5):`, blend_coeff will simply not be a slider on the GUI no more.
- If you write `blend_coeff=[0., 1.]` , blend_coeff will be a slider initalized to 0.5
- If you write `bnw=(True, "black and white", "k")`, the checkbox will disappear and be replaced by a keypress event (press `k` to enable/disable black & white)

## :bulb: Some more tips

```python
from interactive_pipe import interactive, interactive_pipeline
import numpy as np

COLOR_DICT = {"red": [1., 0., 0.],  "green": [0., 1.,0.], "blue": [0., 0., 1.], "gray": [0.5, 0.5, 0.5]}
@interactive()
def generate_flat_colored_image(color_choice=["red", "green", "blue", "gray"], global_params={}):
    '''Generate a constant colorful image
    '''
    flat_array =  np.array(COLOR_DICT.get(color_choice)) * np.ones((64, 64, 3))
    global_params["avg"] = np.average(flat_array)
    return flat_array
```

- Note that you can also create filters which take no inputs and simply "generate" images. 
- The `color_choice` list will be turnt into a nice dropdown menu. Default value here will be red as this is the first element of the list!
----------

:bulb: Can filters communicate together?
Yes, using the special keyword argument `global_params={}`. 
- Check carefully how we stored the image average of the flat image in  global_params. 
- This value will be available to other filters.
`special_image_slice` is going to use that value to set the half bottom image to dark in case the average is high.

```python
@interactive()
def special_image_slice(img, global_params={}):
    if global_params["avg"] > 0.4:
        out_img[out_img.shape[0]//2:, ...] = 0.
    return out_img
```
---


```python
@interactive()
def switch_image(img1, img2, img3, image_index=(0, [0, 2], None, ["pagedown", "pageup", True])):
    '''Switch between 3 images
    '''
    return [img1, img2, img3][image_index]
```
Note that you can create a filter to switch between several images. In `["pagedown", "pageup", True]`, True means that the image_index will wrap around. (it will return to 0 as soon as it goes above the maximum value of 2).

```python
@interactive()
def black_top_image_slice(img, top_slice_black=(True, "special", "k"), global_params={}):
    out_img = img.copy()
    if top_slice_black:
        out_img[:out_img.shape[0]//2, ...] = 0.
    return out_img


@interactive_pipeline(gui="qt", size="fullscreen")
def sample_pipeline_generated_image():
    flat_img = generate_flat_colored_image()
    top_slice_modified = black_top_image_slice(flat_img)
    bottom_slice_modified_image = special_image_slice(flat_img)
    chosen = switch_image(flat_img, top_slice_modified, bottom_slice_modified_image)
    return chosen

if __name__ == '__main__':
    sample_pipeline_generated_image()
```

### History
- Interactive pipe was initially developped by [Balthazar Neveu](https://github.com/balthazarneveu) as part of the [irdrone project](https://github.com/wisescootering/infrareddrone/tree/master/interactive) based on matplotlib.
- Later, more contributions were also made by [Giuseppe Moschetti](https://github.com/g-moschetti) and Sylvain Leroy.
- Summer 2023: rewriting the whole core and supporting several graphical backends!
