# Concept
- Develop your algorithm while debugging with plots, while checking robustness & continuity to parameters change
- Tune your algo and save your parameters for later batch processing
- Ready to batch under the hood, the processing engine can be ran without GUI (therefore allowing to use the same code for tuning & batch processing if needed).
